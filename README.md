# Seam-Carving Algorithm

## Description
Seam Carving is a content-aware resizing technique for images based on a paper written by Shai Avidan (Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs) and Ariel Shamir (The Interdisciplinary Center & MERL). It reduces the dimensions of an image by figuring out what seams are the least important and deleting them. This can be also be used for enlarging images. For this case, The algorithm would have to determine what seams are the most important and then copying them.
